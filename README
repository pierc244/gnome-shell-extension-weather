GNOME Shell Weather Extension
=============================

The GNOME Shell Weather Extension is a simple extension for
displaying weather notifications in GNOME Shell.

Currently, the weather report including forecast for today and
tomorrow is fetched from Yahoo! Weather.

Installation
------------

To install the extension for every user in the computer, run the
following commands as a regular user:

    ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr && make

and then as root (or using sudo):

    make install

Make sure you have the libglib2.0-dev package (or equivalent for
your distribution) installed.

If you want to install the extension only for your user, you can do
the following:

    ./autogen.sh --prefix=$HOME/.local --with-local-install=yes
    make
    make install

After installing the extension restart GNOME Shell by doing "Alt-F2
r ENTER", and then enable it with the gnome-tweak-tool.

To uninstall the extension just do:

    make uninstall

or (if you installed it locally) just delete its directory:

    rm -rf $HOME/.local/share/gnome-shell/weather@gnome-shell-extensions.gnome.org

Remember to first disable it with the gnome-tweak-tool.

Versions
--------

Due to incompatible changes between the different versions of GNOME
Shell, we are currently only supporting GNOME Shell 3.6. However, we
have branches for older versions.

Configuration
-------------

You can use the gnome-shell-extension-prefs tool to configure the
extension. To launch the gnome-shell-extension-prefs tool you can
either do Alt+F2 gnome-shell-extension-prefs ENTER, or you can go to
the Shell Extension section of the Tweak Tool. Next to the check
button for the Weather Extension should be a button that launches
the gnome-shell-extension-prefs tool.

All the configuration changes are reflected in the extension
immediately, there is no need to disable and enable again the
extension.

You can see more screenshots of the gnome-shell-extension-prefs tool
in action in the Screenshots page.

Location
--------

The GNOME Shell Weather Extension uses WOEIDs to know what weather
data should be requested. The preferences for the extension includes
a WOEID searcher: you only need to click in the "Search for WOEID"
button, enter the name of your town or city, and press ENTER or
click in the "Search" button. A list of locations that matches your
search will fill the combo box so you can select the correct one.
