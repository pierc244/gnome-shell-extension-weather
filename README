GNOME Shell Weather Extension
=============================

The GNOME Shell Weather Extension is a simple extension for
displaying weather notifications in GNOME Shell.

Currently, the weather report including forecast for today and
tomorrow is fetched from Yahoo! Weather.

Installation
------------

To install the extension for every user in the computer, run the
following commands as a regular user:

    ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr && make

and then as root (or using sudo):

    make install

Make sure you have the libglib2.0-dev package (or equivalent for
your distribution) installed.

If you want to install the extension only for your user, you can do
the following:

    ./autogen.sh --prefix=$HOME/.local --with-local-install=yes
    make
    make install

After installing the extension restart GNOME Shell by doing "Alt-F2
r ENTER", and then enable it with the gnome-tweak-tool.

To uninstall the extension just do:

    make uninstall

or (if you installed it locally) just delete its directory:

    rm -rf $HOME/.local/share/gnome-shell/weather@gnome-shell-extensions.gnome.org

Remember to first disable it with the gnome-tweak-tool.

Versions
--------

Due to incompatible changes between the different versions of GNOME
Shell, we are currently only supporting GNOME Shell 3.6. However, we
have branches for older versions.

Configuration
-------------

You can use the gnome-shell-extension-prefs tool to configure the
extension. All the configuration changes are reflected in the
extension immediately, there is no need to disable and enable again
the extension.

You can see more screenshots of the gnome-shell-extension-prefs tool
in action in the Screenshots page.

Location
--------

At the moment, only WOEIDs consisting of 4 uppercase letters
followed by 4 digits are supported. Determine your WOEID using
